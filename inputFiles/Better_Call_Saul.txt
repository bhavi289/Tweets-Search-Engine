Better Call Saul follows the life of the character Saul Goodman about six years prior to the events of Breaking Bad.[5] In 2002, Goodman, born as James "Jimmy" McGill, is a former con artist trying to follow a legitimate career as an aspiring lawyer in Albuquerque, New Mexico.[6] He seeks to become a partner in the law firm in which his older brother Charles "Chuck" McGill is a senior partner. However, Jimmy's work is frequently overshadowed by Chuck's past reputation, and he struggles to find a way to prove himself, even with the help of another associate in the firm, Kim Wexler, with whom he also becomes romantically involved. At the same time, Jimmy frequently takes care of Chuck, who claims to have electromagnetic hypersensitivity, a condition that makes him physically ill in the presence of anything with an electrical component and has caused him to take an extended leave from his firm and regular law work. Interspersed among Jimmy's activities are the prior histories of other Breaking Bad characters, including Mike Ehrmantraut, a former police officer who becomes involved in illegal drug trafficking schemes, and drug kingpins Hector Salamanca and Gus Fring, who help distribute drugs illegally brought to the area from Mexico.

The series also provides brief glimpses of Saul's fate some time after the events of the penultimate episode "Granite State" of Breaking Bad, in which Saul, fearing for his own safety, takes on a new identity in Omaha, Nebraska, as a Cinnabon manager and goes by the name Gene. Saul, as Gene, reminisces about his past, but remains paranoid that someone might discover his true identity.

The fourth season features scenes taking place closer to the timeframe of Breaking Bad, which was set in 2008; the story, as described by co-creator Vince Gilligan, "brings us into the world â€” or at least points us on a path toward the world of Walter White and the territory of Walter White".[6] In "Quite a Ride", the cold open takes place concurrent to events near the end of Breaking Bad, with Jimmy as Saul destroying documents and taking money from the Saul Goodman office made memorable in that series.[7
